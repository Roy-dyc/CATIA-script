# CATIA script for automatic work

I am an product engineer, and find some easy but repetitive work when using CATIA. So I learn the script language for CATIA to write the repetitive work to the code script, and it was easy to use in my working environment. 
When writing these script, I read and look up some materials from the web. Regretably I couldn't record all the developer helping me, but still thanks to all of them, although they maybe didn't know they has helped me some moment in their life.
